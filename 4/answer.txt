A web server and web client are key components in designing and serving web pages to users. Here is an explanation of their features and necessity with an example:

Web Server

A web server is responsible for hosting websites and serving requested web pages to clients. Some key features:

Static Content Hosting - The server stores and serves static files like HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
Dynamic Application Logic - For dynamic sites, the server runs application code to generate web pages on the fly based on data.
APIs and Microservices - The server provides APIs and microservices that clients can use to fetch data and utilize backend functionality.
Database Connectivity - The server provides access to databases to store and retrieve data for web apps.
Security - Handles HTTPS, access control, rate limiting, etc. to secure the application and infrastructure.
Web Client

The web client refers primarily to the web browser that requests pages from the server and renders them:

Sending Requests - Clients issue HTTP requests to the server for static assets and dynamic data.
Rendering Content - Browsers parse HTML, CSS and render the web page for the user.
Executing JavaScript - Client-side JS adds interactivity and dynamic effects to pages.
Managing Sessions - Cookies store session data across requests to track logged in users.
Caching - Browsers cache common assets like images and JS files for faster load times.
Example

Consider a simple portfolio website - the server hosts the HTML, CSS and images for the portfolio. When a browser requests the page, the server returns the static assets. The browser then parses these files to render the page. The site may also have a contact form that submits to a server endpoint to send emails. This requires server-side code to handle the form data and send emails dynamically.
